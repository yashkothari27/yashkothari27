## 🔥 A Bit About Me

Hey, internet! 👋 I’m **Yash**, a passionate Blockchain Developer who lives and breathes smart contracts, validator nodes, and caffeinated code sprints. Whether it's Solidity sorcery or Web3 wizardry, I’m your guy. 🧙‍♂️💻

> “Why follow the chain when you can *build* it?”

## 🎓 Learning Curve (aka How I Upgraded Myself)

* 🧠 **MCA** - GLS University, Ahmedabad (2021 - 2023)
* 🎓 **BCA** - Gujarat University, Ahmedabad (2018 - 2021)
* 🛠️ Majored in Ctrl+C, Minored in Ctrl+V... then learned better.

## 💼 Where I Left My Mark

### 🏥 **Reltime AS – Software Engineer (Blockchain)**

*Jul 2024 – Present*

* Built a **multi-chain platform** with AI, IPFS, and HIPAA-level security. Basically a tech smoothie. 🧃
* Unified 15+ healthcare APIs. Doctors smiled. Coders cried (with joy). 🧑‍⚕️🤖
* Designed a **SuperApp** with tokenized savings, Web3 wallet & cross-border magic (Visa, SWIFT, etc). 🌍💸
* Fractionalized real estate. 🏠💰 Who knew tokens could own land?

### 🪑 **TSC Design – Software Engineer (Blockchain + Backend)**

*Jan 2024 – Sep 2024*

* Built a blockchain-based Google Drive for files. But decentralized. And cooler. 📁🔐
* Boosted e-com conversions with faster pages and slick payments. 💳⚡
* Delivered GDPR-compliant systems so clean, even regulators clapped. 👏🕵️

### 🌐 **Web4Next – Software Engineer (Blockchain)**

*Dec 2022 – Dec 2023*

* Made **Ethereum DApps** that made real estate NFTs feel like child’s play. 🏘️🧠
* Built a **Ripple wallet** with MetaMask vibes. Fast, secure, and smooth like butter. 💳⚙️
